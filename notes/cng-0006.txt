This lesson is all about "haber"

haber
to have (as in: to have done)
(0+2=2)

hay
there is / there are
(2+2=4)

Special tenses
(Usually not covered by formula - as they are
regular -- but since 'haber' is special, I may
as well include them anyway.)
(4+2=6)

Present - Indicative
(6+6=12)

Simple Past - Indicative
(12+6=18)
