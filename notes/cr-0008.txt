#43: ha
ha = a form of "haber"

haber
to have (as in "to have done")
(0+2=2)

Special tenses:
(2+2=4)

Present
(4+6=10)

Also - let us define "hay", which is technically
an alternative third-person indicative present singular
form of "haber" --- but to avoid confusion will not
be presented as such. Due to it's technical relation
to "haber", it should be presented in the same
lesson as the rest of the indicative present.

But no need to change the order - because it anyways
will be in this lesson.


#43: ahora


#44: esta


#45: hay
