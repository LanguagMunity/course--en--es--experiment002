Subjunctive
- Rare Imperfect



The Rare Imperfect (one of the tenses in the Subjunctive
mood) may be taught after all other forms of
conjugation are well learned. This is because the Rare
Imperfect is only used in Spain and my focus is on
Latin American Spanish (of which American Spanish
is a subset). The more common Subjunctive Imperfect
form I will not wait so long for.
