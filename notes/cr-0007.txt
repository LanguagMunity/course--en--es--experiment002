#42: vamos
A form of "ir"

ir
to go
(0+2=2)

CONJUGATE: ir - Present - Indicative
(2+6=8)

CONJUGATE: ir - Imperative
(8+6=14)
(Of course - I have concluded that
"vamos" does not occur there - because
just because it can be used as a command
does not make it an imperative form - as
in any language, commands are often phrased
in the indicative - the most famous
example possibly being the Ten Commandments,
though by no means the only example.
Nonetheless, though the Imperative form
does not include "vamos", I have decided
to use it here anyway - just so that there
be no confusion on the matter.)

Let us not forget how "ir" is
related to "irse" - but that is
a matter for another lesson.

Oops --- I almost forgot --
let us not leave out the special tenses!!!!
