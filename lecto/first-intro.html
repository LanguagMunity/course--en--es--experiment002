General Introduction

<p class = "first">
As is part of the philosophy around which LanguaMunity was developed,
the way this course works does not involve the stand-alone use of
the software.
Rather, the software is meant to be used as part of
a learning process that relies heavily on immersion as well.
In a sense, the immersion process of learning a language
can be likened to being dropped into a deep river -
and this program (together with proper reference materials)
can be likened to a raft and a paddle.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, reading will prove to be a very useful tool
in your immersion process.
Reading in your target language can have many benefits
- among the many of them being that it can supplement your
conversational immersion in the event that you don't
get enough of it.
However, there is a bare minimun of conversational
immersion that you must have for which no amount
of reading, TV watching, or anything else can
substitute.
Fortunately, if you live in the United States,
Spanish is probably the easiest language to
get this conversational immersion in
(with the possible exception of English, which
you should already be fluent in if you are
reading this document).
</p>

<p>
Despite the lack of official
recognition,
Spanish is as much a part of the USA
as French is a part of our neighbor to
the North, Canada.
The process of this becoming so
began early in our nation's history
with the annexation of Florida,
and continued with other events
such as the annexation of Texas,
California, and other places
formerly part of Mexico.
While it is true that an influx
of immigration from Mexico increased
the prevalence of Spanish in the USA,
it is by no means the sole source of this.
</p>

<p>
Because of the place Spanish has
in the fabric of the United States,
finding conversational immersion
opportunities should be easier than
with other languages.
However, if you can't find a
good conversational
immersion opportunity in-person,
try at least to get an online
immersion-opportunity using
technologies such as VOIP.
More information on how to do this
will be made available here (albeit
through a hyperlink) as soon as we
have more specific suggestions
to offer.
</p>

<p>
Nonetheless - being new to
the language, there are certain
things you need to be able to say
in your target language as you
jump into the deep waters of
conversational immersion.
You need to be able to excuse
yourself for not really knowing
the language yet - and be able
to ask for certain considerations
in light of your lack of knowledge
of the language.
LanguaMunity refers to the
expressions you will need to
know for this purpose as
"Newbie Expressions".
The first few lessons in this
course will be dedicated to them
(as is the case with any
properly-composed LanguaMunity
course).
</p>

<p>
Another thing you will need
in this course from the very
beginning and throughout the
learning process is good
reference materials.
For this reason, there are
three web-sites you should acquaint
yourself with right now (all three
of which have apps available both
for Android and for IOS).
These sites are
<a href = "http://translate.google.com" target = "_blank">Google Translate</a>,
<a href = "http://www.spanishdict.com" target = "_blank">SpanishDict</a>,
and
<a href = "http://www.wordreference.com" target = "_blank">WordReference</a>.
As soon as possible you should visit all three
of these sites and get to know how to use
them effectively.
It is also recommended to install all three
apps on your phone if you have a phone with
which they are compatible.
They will be even more useful when you start
reading in Spanish - but will already be
useful when your immersion is just conversational.
</p>

<p>
However - <b>do not use these online tools,
or any tools at all for that matter, to cheat
while using this program's flashcards. As
a matter of fact, try to make sure that all
windows to these sites are closed when you're
doing a flashcard session.</b>
This is very important, because if you cheat,
<b>then the one whom you are cheating is
yourself</b>.
