Importance of Reading

At this point, the flashcards are going to start
drifting away from focusing on full sentences,
and move toward individual words and phrases.
So you wonder -- with such a system, if the
program is going to focus on just teaching you
the pieces of the language, how are you going
to get a firm grasp on how it all fits together?
</p>

<p>
The answer is to <span class = "em">read, read,
and read some more</span>.
There is plenty of reading material available
in Spanish - and you need to make use of it.
As previously mentioned - the LanguaMunity software
is not intended as a stand-alone system for learning
a language, but is rather intended to work along-side
immersion.
Also as stated, reading is an important part of
this immersion process.
</p>

<p>
Start with material of a very beginnerish reading
level, and work yourself up gradually.
Eventually, there is the goal of providing here
a list of some reading suggestions -- but for now,
that's a future prospect on the to-do list.
But not to worry - even though we can't (at the
present time) point you to any such reading material,
there is plenty of it out there.
</p>

<p>
You may still need to use the reference materials
pointed to in the first lecture-page of this course.
Hopefully by now you will have gained a grasp at
what the strength and weaknesses of each reference
resource so you can use them accordingly.
