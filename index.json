Yes, it uses\ndata collected for the purpose of that approach in it's\nformulation - but merely as a guide. It treats every part of\nthe language, however, with more sensitivity than a 'core\nvocabulary' approach does.\n\nRemember that the LanguaMunity program is not a full course\nin any language - but is intended as a tool to be used in\nconjunction with immersion."
